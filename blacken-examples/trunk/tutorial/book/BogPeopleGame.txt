# Appendix: Original "Bog People" Game Idea

## Life stages of the Bog People

Bog people have 5 major life stages:

### Eggs

In water, at surface. They float on the surface.

When dried they are an explosive if packed close together.

When preserved, they can act as a grenade-like weapon.
Only Bog-dwellers can stomach them.

Stolen fresh eggs draw all kinds of Bog dwellers, unless eggs are in an
enclosed, airtight container (like a flask).

In canabalistic (or post-canabalistic) communities, eggs may be dried or
preserved. (And bought/sold.)

* Are eggs always eaten to keep population down?
* In canabalistic starving communities, larve may eat eggs.
* Normally, just larva are eaten?

### Larval / Tadpole

In water, under surface. Smell upstream / nearby.

### Surface / Amphibian

Located in/near water at/in edge.

* play but have limited senses
* like children, they must be protected

### Pupal / listening stone

Located in/near (bog) town.

* primary purpose is to hear stories of people and goings on in town.

### Adult

Adults must "prove themselves" shortly after metamorphosis and before they
breed.

## History and plot design

* initially they are peaceful and in balance with their neighbors
* they are Chaotic and neighboring town is Lawful

### First branch

(1) farmer produces a "swamp monster" contest to see who can kill the most swamp monsters

Normally, the contest is halted before it begins by the sheriff or by a local minister.

### All adults killed

If all adults are killed, the current listening stones (when metamorphosis is complete) will hunt down and kill the responsible parties.

* First they breed furiously
* Amphibians are taught "things" (play-battle)
* stories are told to new batch of listening stones
* they will try to learn the ways of war first

### All adults and listening stones killed

If all adults and listening stones are killed, most amphibians die off, the rest become stronger and tougher.

* If there is enough food, they will eat the food.
* else, they will resort to canabalism, and the survivors will lead a new vile, uncivil, dangerous warlike nation.
  + In more serious situations, canabalism may occur at any life stage.

All members of populations responsible become KOS (in Bogtown) in the future.

They will eventually mass and try to destroy the neighboring town.

### All adults and amphibians killed

If all adults and amphibians are killed, a larger, stronger, more
determined party will go after the people responsible.

### Top 3 stages killed

If top 3 stages killed, then the culture is destroyed.

Future generations are more warlike and barbaric

* Language is lost in Bog town
* All non-Bog People are KOS

Culture can be reestablished if the town gains contact with
another Bog town.

If left alone, eventually overpopulation and then canabalism sets in. -- Followed by disastrous war with neighbors.

* This happens after new barbaric culture is established.
* Pre-canabalism new culture is focused on pleasure and
  future apocalypse.
* Canabalism is viewed as the end of the world/culture.
* Post-canabalism culture is focused on war, domination,
  power and control

Note: If the top 3 stages are killed, the damage is much more long-term and severe.

# Appendix: Revised plot for Tutorial Game

## What we're dropping

No more breeding or evolving. No "barbaric" versions without culture.

No more "listening stone" and "surface" stages. They're less like insects and
more like traditional frogs.

## What is being changed

Instead we have Gandalf-like "mighty wizard" who travels from
place-to-place. (The Ochre Mage?)

The Bog People are the natural predator both of their own kin (which can
still overflow into town) as well as the _actual_ Swamp Orcs, who have a
similar life-cycle, but normally live under water.

## Structure of the game

### Quest: Contest afoot

Swamp isn't a threat.

Bog people can be easily killed.

Bog magic is ineffective at offense.

Only clump of armed Bog people were near the "dark well" which can't be
damaged with player-provided tools.

### Outcome: Halted Contest

The player prevented the contest from happening.

#### Unique side-quest: Orc in town.

After Ochre Mage visits and goes to see the Swamp People, an isolated
genuine adult Swamp Orc shows up in town and must be dispatched. Player
doesn't know what it is, but entire town knows it isn't the beasts that
live in the swamp.

He is the only one in town capable of stopping the Swamp Orc. There may
be some villagers that try, but they will fail. (In fact, the villagers
may be responsible poorly aimed flaming arrows. -- Setting homes on fire.)

On failure: Either "home-damaged" or "home-destroyed"

#### Common side-quest: Find the Ochre Mage in the Bog Village (Swamp Survival)

Swamp is significantly dangerous -- Bog People have bred things to
fight the Swamp Orcs.

Ochre Mage informs of Swamp Orcs.

#### Future Goal: Remove the new Under-Bog exit

We find there's another exit and the Swamp Orcs are becoming a greater
threat.

#### Unique side-quest: Rescue Kermit

Bog-people-provided "test" that must be completed: rescue Kermit
who was caught by the spiders being bred by his father and return him to
his mother. The request is specifically for Kermit's body "dead or alive".

Kermit can't be carried with your equipment. You need to abandon most of
your belongings to carry Kermit -- unless you butcher him.

##### On success (alive)

Kermit gives him Glug-glug Root bypassing "Glug-glug Root" quest.

##### On success (dead)

The Bog People ignore him and disappear for a bit. When
they return, Kermit is recovering in bed. Kermit tells the location of the
Glug-glug root he had in his father's camp. (Flash to camp and highlight
location. If unknown, know the cells around the item only.)

##### Failure to return the corpse

You will get no further help until the corpse
is returned -- lost time. A failure to return the corpse is a failure of the
test. He is unworthy of the task ahead.

At first failure, require "Glug-glug Root" quest. (He's seen as
semi-incompetant and they are unsure if he'll survive what lies ahead.)

##### Returning desecrated corpse (just bones/head/etc)

They are not happy.

Flag "no-restoration".

Require "Glug-glug Root" quest.

#### Common Quest: Collect Glug-glug Root

Pick up the common plot-line at "Collect Glug-glug Root" (or just after if he
already has one).

### Outcome: Imperfect Genocide

Ochre Mage visits to warn that someone or something killed most of the Bog
People, and as a result their population is going to spike. S/He warns that
s/he must go and try to civalize them and will be unable help when the
Boglings eventually swarm.

#### Unique side-quest: Bogling Swarm

Prevent your town from being overrun by Boglings -- scaled up in number
for the life stages that were killed off.

On failure: Either "home-damaged" or "home-destroyed"

After the Boglings storm town, you must enter Swamp Town to check on the
Ochre Mage.

#### Goal: Find the Ochre Mage in the Bog Village (Village Battle)

Swamp is as peaceful as before -- if not more so.

When you reach Bog Town, you find the Ochre Mage protecting a group of
Boglings from an attacking band of Swamp Orcs.

After killing off the Swamp Orcs you're seen as a mighty hero to the
Boglings -- adored. The Boglings offer to go get a Glug-glug Root for
you, but the Ochre Mage refuses and says you must get it.

The Ochre Mage informs you that the People used to get fresh
root in a valley on the other side of the mountains, but that the mountains
have recently become infested with rats. This is worrisome as the
Shadow of Fear -- where the Glug-glug root is found -- is a regular
haunt of necromancers, and the spiders have an uncanny nack for
neutralizing the undead.

#### Future Goal: Remove the new Under-Bog exit

The Boglings have found another exit in the Under-Bog. (It flashes on
screen.) The Ochre Mage informs you it must be removed.

#### Common Quest: Collect Glug-glug Root

Pick up the common plot-line at "Collect Glug-glug Root".

### Outcome: Genocide

Ochre Mage visits to warn that someone or something killed all of the Bog
People, and as a result the Swamp Orc population will be growing
out-of-control.

The Ochre Mage must see about a "bride" of the only species that is left
that is a natural Swamp Orc predator. S/he is very imprecise, and you get
no additional help from the Ochre Mage -- gone until the end-scene.

#### Unique side-quest: Seal the Dark Well

When blame is directed at you, you are given the task of sealing "the dark
well" in the Bog Town.

The swamp on the way there quiet, though there are some scattered (new)
skeletons.

The Dark Well is surrounded by a dispatch of adult Swamp Orcs.

#### Unique side-quest: Zombie invasion

After well is sealed and orcs killed you return home to find it swarming
with undead Bog People killing/burning town. No one actually dies until
you get there.

#### Common Quest: Collect Glug-glug Root

The town elder knows that the Shadow of Fear is commonly used by necromancers.

During the invasion there was one undead Swamp Orc, and the elders came to the
consensus that there's probably another entrance to the Under-Bog in that
area.

Without the Ochre Mage to provide another Seal, the elders recommend eating
some of the Glug-glug root that grows in the Shadow of Fear, and doing the
job the Bog People would have done -- culling the over-abundance of Orclets.

There is some disagreement about this, and the player makes out,
"transformation", "s/he brought this on 'erself", and "perhaps the Ochre Mage
can change him/her back if s/he survives."

Everyone knows that even if there is only one entrance, it won't last forever.
Even the Ochre Mage wasn't sure it would last until s/he returned. If there's
a second exit, the population pressures need to be reduced or next time there
will be even greater numbers.

If s/he was unsuccessful at saving his town (which should be quite likely),
the player will not actually have anyone to give her/him direction. In this
case the quest title becomes "Seek Vengence" with the actual goals the same.

### Flag: home-okay

Fully functional town store.

Important for: weapons, armor, food, ritual supplies

### Flag: home-damaged

A subset of town and the population are destroyed.
Did he save his two sweethearts? Just one? Their parents?

Town store only has essentials.

Important for: food, ritual supplies

### Flag: home-destroyed

Both the person-he-loves (but his/her
parents disprove), and the person-that-loves-him (and his/her parents
adore him) are killed. So are his parents. In fact, the town is burned
to the ground. (In an attempt to destroy the fire, the Orc collapses
houses, crushing those inside and setting them ablaze in the process.

You have no town store. No supplies other than what were already collected.

Since setting up camp automatically gathers and prepares food if none is
already available, this doesn't mean automatic death.

It is very unlikely for this to happen when the player does not already
have a weapon. We can detect this and "find" a club when entering the
forest.

### Common Quest: Collect Glug-glug Root

Regardless of how we got here, we need to aquire Glug-glug Root.

Collect Glug-glug Root from beyond Spider Valley in the
Shadow of Fear (Point) -- where an amateur Necromancer from out-of-town
has set up shop.

Variation: If in 'contest-halted' branch, the spiders are the larger
threat. Otherwise the undead (and rats) are the larger threat. Genocide
means there were a surplus of bodies to use.

The Spiders' webs contain occult symbols which neutralize the undead.
Even a small spider web will neutralize the undead. The enhanced-threat
spiders are not larger, but their webs are more magical so they can
neutralize a broader swath of beings.

Part of the journey involves leading zombies and other undead in to webs,
while avoiding them yourself.

Defeating the necromancer involves hitting him with fresh meat. He has
inadvertently surrounded himself with rats (which have been consuming
his army). When they smell the fresh meat on him, they swarm and devour
him. (He might hit the meat with some magic, causing it to explode
in a bloody mess.)

### Common Quest: Descend the Dark Well

With the Glug-glug Root you can now descend in to the world of the Swamp
Orcs by way of the Dark Well. (Or the Alternate Entrance) The root provokes
a transformation -- which only the adult Bog People can reverse -- and even
then only if they want to. 

The Swamp Orcs -- when under water -- do not recognize you as a threat. They
recognize you as a "foreigner" -- but you are clearly not a Bog Person, and
they have no enemies (in this part of the world) other than Bog People below
the surface.

Like the Bog People, they eat their own young, but in an effort to protect
them from the Bog People, they've been hiding them in chambers under
ground.

#### Common quest: Remove the new Under-Bog exit

It turns out the new Under-Bog exit is clearly fragile and easy to collapse.

### Common Quest: Cull a clutch before it ascends toward town

They need to cull a clutch so that they don't burst forth and
start more slaughter.

While there, we find someone having a snack.

We're then informed that there is a city, and that there's an Orc King/Queen
who is responsible for the new ideas and approaches. The general sentiment
is that all the mazes and dungeons are an inconvienance and that it makes it
harder for everyone to eat regularly. They don't even actually want to live
in a city.

The King/Queen is also a foreigner -- but a foreigner from the Sacred
Clutch -- an ancient and sacred nesting site.

### Common Quest: An Audience with the King/Queen

Audience with the King/Queen is easy to achieve -- just pass through a
series of dungeons. There s/he accuses you of being from "Accursed
Yith" -- 'Yith' not being a town you're familiar with it leads you to the
Sacred Clutch and a new set of dungeons.

### Common Quest: The Accursed City

In the Sacred Clutch is a magic portal. On the other side is Yith. Yith
doesn't seem at all "accursed" -- they seem happy and healthy. Meeting the
village elder reveals that the Consort of Demons was banished due
to -- surprise! -- conjuring evil forces. You are given a sacred artifact
with which to neutralize him/her and which will protect you from him/her
magic in the future. It will not protect you from the demons s/he summons,
though.

### Common Quest: Returning the Consort

Prior to visiting Yith, the city was covered in hiddeous deformed
statuary. The primary occupation of the workers of Yith was to slave away
creating this statuary. When you return, all of these statues are flowing
with vibrant life. Evil, hiddeous mockeries of life, but seemingly
self-aware. You need to get through the dungeon for the palace and confront
the King/Queen.

The actual confrontation is a non-event due to the
artifact -- and when placed around his/her neck both of them _poof_ off to
Yith.

### Common Quest: Return to Bog Town

Upon returning to Bog Town -- where the Ochre Mage promised to meet
you -- you are confronted with the fact that the Glug-glug Root has turned
you in to a hiddeous beast. It wraps us back up to the consequences of our
initial actions:

#### Contest Halted

Flag "no-restoration":

You are told "the Bog People are still sore with you about Kermit and refuse
to restore you to normal."

Jump to "Partial Genocide's trailer with the Ochre Mage leading you away.

Otherwise:

The Bog People use their magic to restore you to normal where you can reunite
with your surviving sweetheart(s). (If s/he survived the Swamp Orc attack.)

#### Partial genocide

You are informed the Bog People _used_ to have a method of restoring folks
to normal after they've eaten the Glug-glug Root, but that it was lost. The
Ochre Mage did his best to try to recover the lost secrets, but the Mage's
ritual magic is quite different than the Bog People's holistic magic.

You are escourted by the Ochre Mage to a land where you will fit in better
and might yet find a mate.

#### Genocide

You are met in Bog Town by your "bride" -- a being even more hiddeous than
yourself -- and the Ochre Mage. The Ochre Mage assures you that he's performed
magic on the "bride" to make sure she is biologically compatable with you.

The two of you will be raising a new people in Bog Town -- as someone needs
to be around to cull off the Swamp Orcs when their population gets out of
control.

# Game Mechanics

## Stamina versus Hunger

While we could go with a "stamina" stat, this can be used like the hunger
count. Due to religious observances, you must only eat in camp. Foraging
while in camp is always successful -- and slows you down predictably.

## Time-constrained

There's no point in having a concept of "camping" and using either stamina
or hunger if there isn't something to be lost by it.

That is, a technique that can't fail should just be removed.

So, there's a day-counter, and when the count reaches zero a massive army of
Orclets hatch, eat everything they can and head for the surface. Your town
includes "everything" as does you. (And even their parents.)

This is because the King/Queen _thinks_ s/he is raising an army. There's a bit
of a disconnect on the exact nature of the Orclets and exactly how hungry they
are when they are born.

## Rules

The only rules to implement are the rules that will serve the game.

I'm favoring modeling things after Fudge, with a simple triple set of core
attributes.

Skills? Maybe, maybe not. If I have professions, they can be implemented as
skills.

I favor scaling everything on the player's level and never
attribute-bumping.
