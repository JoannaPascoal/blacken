# The structure of the example code

This book has been written so that the example code package is optional.

This means that all of the source used in the tutorial is available as program listings in the book.

Some people find they learn better by actively retyping code in to an editor.

Due to the way Java organizes the packages, you need to know how the code is expected to be structured even if you're going to retype everything.

The main tutorial game is in:

    src/main/java
    src/main/resources

We will be periodically covering packages and classes we expect to be in the final version of the game. Interspersed within these will be one-off tests and reproducible automated unit tests. Both unittests and interactive tests will exist in the following location:

    src/test/java
    src/test/resources

Unittests will exist in packages that packages that mirror the source that they will be testing. Most of these will exist somewhere in:

    com.googlecode.blacken.tutorial

The one-off and other interactive tests are located in a different package:

    tutorial

If you are forking this codebase to create your own project you can drop everything in this non-standard "tutorial" package as none of it will be of value to you.
